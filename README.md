## Project Context
We are currently studying Front End Developement at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://frontend.turing.edu/). This project was structured as a paired project in Mod 3 ('Rancid Tomatillos'), completed approximately four months into our coding career.

Goals for this project included:
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS using Cypress
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using Router
